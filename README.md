gridfill
========

Fill missing values in a grid by solving Poisson's equation via an iterative relaxation scheme.

Requirements
------------

``gridfill`` requires ``numpy`` and a Fortran compiler for installation. It has only been tested
with ``gfortran`` thus far.

``gridfill`` can also operate on `iris` cubes, which requires the `iris` package to be installed.
